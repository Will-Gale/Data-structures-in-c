# Tree-data-structures

This C program is written and tested on Mac OSX and tested on a Debian Linux OS. You must create your own variables to enter into the data structures and pass them as void pointers. You must also have a compare function that accepts two void pointers and returns an integer. I have included struct.c and struct.h files as an example of the requirements. In this example the variable stores a student's last name and student number (separated by a comma). There is more information on the files in the header files.

Compilation
Use make to build the object files for your current architecture in the main directory of this package. 

Running
Use whatever method you would like to insert data into the data structures. A user interface will be implemented soon.
