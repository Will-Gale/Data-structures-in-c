# Data-structures-in-c

This C program is written and tested on Mac OSX and tested on a Debian Linux OS. You must create your own variables to enter into the data structures and pass them as void pointers. You must also have a compare function that accepts two void pointers and returns an integer for sorting the data put into the tree. I have included ADT.c and ADT.h files as an example of the requirements. The ADT files are abstract data types that can be used with this assortment of data structures. In this example the variable stores a student's last name and student number (separated by a comma). There is more information on the files in the header files. Each code is written independent of one another for an object oriented approach.

Compilation
Use make to build the object files for your current architecture in the main directory of this package. 

Running
Use whatever method you would like to insert data into the data structures. A user interface will be implemented soon.


Future improvements
FIFO.c
LIFO.c
- Include a struct to define list length as well as a toString function
HashMap.c
- Let the user define a hashFunction that returns an integer, store void pointers inside the hashmap
Sorting.c
